            <br>
            <p class="card-text">The Virginia Solar Database (VSD) provides a summary of large-scale solar projects proposed for siting approval at the local level in Virginia. It includes projects over 1 MW (with the exception of BARC Community Solar Project in Bath County) that have been advertised for a local public hearing. The database excludes school and government installations and procurement projects (with some exceptions for notable projects such as NASA Wallops, Oceana, and landfill projects such as Campostella).   
            <br><br>
            While the information we have compiled is all already publicly available, this is the state's first and only comprehensive source of this data.
            <br><br>
            Project data is current through <b>April 1, 2025</b>. 
            <br><br>
            <b>New Datapoints for March 2025:</b> Pollinator-Smart datapoints added from the <a href="https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/natural-heritage/pollinator-smart"> Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation. </a> For more information about native vegetation requirements, see the <a href="https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/natural-heritage/document/va-solarordin-natveg.pdf">Virginia Localities Solar Ordinances and Native Vegetation</a> report from DCR. Datapoints for local permit amendment dates and amendment descriptions were also released.
